// 3.local Reposatary
// 4. is Remote reposatary

//1.this is all about making and Initializing the project**********************
// initialsize the project using  command ->                               git init
//check ststus of the git using command ->                                 git status
//then add the present directory to the staging command->                  git add file or folder//git add --all,git add .
//then from the statting to the local repotatory using command->           git commmit -m "Discription"
// It will show all the details                                            git log//git checkout
//to create branches command->                                             git checkout -b "branch name"
//then push from the local reporaties to remote reporatires command ->     git push -u "File or Foldername"



//2.this all about the already the reporaties in the Remote Reporatory *******************
//then step one fork the repotatry the the remote reporatory will come into the our local GitHub
//then make the changes and send Pull request to the Remote repotatory Admin if it is ok then he will Mergr it 


//3.How to Handle the Merge Conflict error
//supose two people are workinng in same file then conflict error Uccur first person is pushed this one is correcct 
//but second person  is saying that his change is ccorrect
//we solve this problem once see video in the Utube command ->git merge origin/master after this command we have to go vs code 
//git push
